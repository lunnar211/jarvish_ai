Jarvis AI - Personal Voice Assistant
Description: Jarvis AI is an advanced, voice-activated personal assistant inspired by the fictional AI from Iron Man. This project combines speech recognition, natural language processing (NLP), and face recognition to create an interactive system capable of performing system tasks, providing updates, and controlling connected devices. Jarvis AI works both online and offline and features a user interface that replicates the look and feel of Tony Stark's iconic assistant.

Features:

Voice Recognition: Real-time speech recognition and command execution.
Face Authentication: Secure access through face recognition.
Natural Language Processing: Understands and processes voice commands intelligently.
System Control: Executes system-level tasks like opening applications, controlling devices, and managing system files.
Weather and News Updates: Integrated plugins provide real-time weather information and news updates.
Iron Man-Inspired Interface: User interface modeled after the visual design of Jarvis in Iron Man, including dynamic elements and voice feedback.
Extensible Architecture: Modular design allows for adding additional features and functionalities.
Installation & Setup Instructions
Prerequisites:
Python 3.x
Pip (Python package manager)
Virtual environment (venv)
Webcam (for face recognition)
Internet connection (for online features and APIs)
Clone the Repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/lunnar211/jarvis-ai.git
cd jarvis-ai
Create and Activate Virtual Environment:
bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
Install Dependencies:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Download Additional Files (e.g., Model Weights, Dependencies):
Ensure that the haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml file is available in the appropriate directory for face recognition.

Set Up API Keys:
Google Cloud Speech-to-Text API: Set up Google Cloud Speech-to-Text for voice recognition.
Cookies: Add cookies.json (from HuggingFace or other authentication services) for authentication and secure communication.
Run the Application:
To start Jarvis, simply run the main Python script:

bash
Copy code
python main.py
Using Jarvis:
Jarvis will prompt you to authenticate using face recognition.
Once authenticated, you can issue voice commands, such as:
"Open Google Chrome"
"What's the weather today?"
"Play some music"
You will see the responses both in the GUI and hear them via voice feedback.
Directory Structure:
core: Core functionalities like NLP, speech recognition, system control.
engine: Authentication, helper functions, and feature modules.
plugins: Weather and news plugins.
web: User interface assets (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, audio, images).
requirements.txt: List of dependencies.
main.py: Entry point for the Jarvis AI system.
Future Improvements:
Extend NLP functionality: Incorporate more sophisticated natural language understanding.
Add more system commands: Implement additional system management features like file handling or application control.
Enhance the UI: Further improve the user interface to create a more immersive experience.
Known Issues:
Ensure that your system's audio settings allow Jarvis to play sounds and respond with voice feedback.
The webcam must be properly connected for face authentication to work.
